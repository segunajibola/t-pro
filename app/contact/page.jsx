      <p className="w-[80%] mx-auto text-center">
        Aminat Quadri is Co-Owner and head of operations at Studio Sashiko.
        Kyle has worked within the Tattoo industry since 2007, receiving a Body
        Piercing apprenticeship. He most recently acted as manager at a shop
        practicing body piercing, before opening Studio Sashiko with his wife,
        Shaughnessy. Kyleâ€™s creative direction with Studio Sashiko is highly
        influenced by a passion for high fashion, street fashion, design and
        architecture. His ability to spot and embrace creative trends has
        allowed Studio Sashiko to realize itself not only as a leader in quality
        and hyper-realistic work, but as a brand that is trail-blazing within
        the industry.
